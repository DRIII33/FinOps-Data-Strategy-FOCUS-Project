This portfolio project is designed to showcase the full range of skills required for a **Senior Data Strategist at IBM Cloudability**, specifically focusing on data architecture, normalization (via a **FOCUS-like schema**), and the creation of high-impact financial metrics like **Unit Economics** for the FinOps Executive Dashboard.

**Project: FOCUS-Aligned Multi-Cloud Data Strategy for Cloudability: Driving Unit Economics & Forecast Accuracy**

**1. Research-Driven Business Scenario & Problem**
The project is grounded in current (as of December 2025) challenges in the FinOps industry, as highlighted by FinOps Foundation reports and industry trends.

**Synthesized Challenges & Role Alignment:**
| **Industry Challenge (Dec 2025)**                       | **Senior Data Strategist Mandate**                                                                                   | **Dashboard Element Affected**        |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Multi-Cloud Complexity & FOCUS Adoption                  | Define the architecture to ingest, normalize, and model billing data from AWS, Azure, GCP into a unified (FOCUS-like) schema. | Allocation, Spend Trend                |
| Low Data Quality (Inconsistent Tags)                     | Implement data quality checks (DQ) and define logic to handle "unallocated" resources, increasing allocation accuracy.        | Cost Allocation Rate                   |
| Quantifying Business Value (Unit Economics)              | Partner with Product/Data Science to integrate business data (DAU) with cost data to calculate Cost per X.                    | Unit Economics                         |
| Forecast/Budgetary Uncertainty                           | Provide high-quality, normalized data to reduce forecast variance and eliminate "invoice shock."                             | Forecast vs. Actual Spend              |

**Business Scenario: Stratosphere Tech**
IBM Cloudability has a major client, **'Stratosphere Tech'**, a rapidly growing multi-cloud (AWS and GCP) SaaS provider whose executive leadership is demanding greater **financial accountability and predictability**.
* **Current State Challenge:** The current cost allocation rate is dangerously low (≈62%) due to inconsistent tagging, leading to high forecast variance (over 15% MoM) and a lack of trust in the numbers.
* **Business Problem Statement:** Stratosphere Tech lacks **trustworthy, unified, and business-aligned multi-cloud cost data**, preventing the calculation of the **Cost per Daily Active User (DAU)** for their flagship product, 'Aether', which is critical for strategic pricing and capacity decisions.
* **Strategic Goal:** The Data Strategist will define the data foundation to achieve 95% **cost allocation accuracy** and produce the reliable **Unit Economics** metric required for executive decision-making.
