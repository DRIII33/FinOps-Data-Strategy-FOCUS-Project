## IBM Cloudability FinOps Data Strategy Project: Executive Summary

**Project Focus:** FOCUS-Aligned Multi-Cloud Data Strategy Implementation
**Deliverable:** Normalized BigQuery Analytics View (`FINOPS_FOCUS_ANALYTICS`) and Unit Economics Report

### 1. Executive Summary & Strategic Insight

The implementation of the **FINOPS\_FOCUS\_ANALYTICS** view has successfully achieved data normalization, enabling the calculation of our key metric: **Cost per Daily Active User (Cost/DAU)** for the 'Aether' product.

**Key Finding:** Over the past six months (June to November 2025), the Cost/DAU for Aether has remained remarkably stable, fluctuating between **\$0.0006 and \$0.0007**. This stability provides the Product team with a clear, reliable boundary for pricing and scaling decisions.

| Month | Total Monthly DAU (Aether) | Total Product Cost (USD) | Cost per DAU (USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025-06** | 59,530,808 | $\$36,389.86$ | **\$0.0006** |
| **2025-07** | 85,825,714 | $\$53,904.14$ | **\$0.0006** |
| **2025-08** | 80,918,978 | $\$53,705.71$ | **\$0.0007** |
| **2025-09** | 83,580,507 | $\$57,275.22$ | **\$0.0007** |
| **2025-10** | 91,558,851 | $\$64,459.50$ | **\$0.0007** |
| **2025-11** | 96,840,020 | $\$62,137.28$ | **\$0.0006** |

The slight elevation in August, September, and October to **\$0.0007** (a change of $\approx 16\%$) correlates with a period of high, unoptimized usage of multi-cloud networking and compute services. This is the first time the business has been able to link a marginal cost increase directly to the Unit Economic outcome.

### 2. Allocation Rate (Data Quality KPI)

While Unit Economics are now available, the **underlying data quality issue persists**. The analytic view correctly flags all unallocated costs using the 'UNKNOWN' dimension.

| Month | Initial Allocation Rate | Unallocated Spend (USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025-06** | $61.56\%$ | $\$55,771.96$ |
| **2025-11** | $60.76\%$ | $\$97,180.35$ |

**Action Required:** The $\approx 62\%$ allocation rate remains static. The data strategy has provided the necessary **visibility and measurement**, but achieving the target of **$95\%$ allocation accuracy** requires **organizational and process change**, specifically mandatory tagging enforcement across all cloud resources. The Data Strategy Team will now transition to supporting the implementation of governance tooling (e.g., Cloud Custodian) to enforce the required tagging policies.

### 3. Conclusion

The project successfully delivered a **single, reliable analytic source** that connects multi-cloud cost data to a vital business metric (Cost/DAU). This shifts the conversation from raw cost reporting to **cost *governance* and *value-driven* spend**. The FinOps team must now leverage this insight to drive process compliance and resource optimization efforts.

### Project Close-out

With the generation of this final analysis document, the rollout of the project is complete, covering all aspects from data generation and documentation to architectural transformation and executive reporting. All files are now structurally accounted for within the planned GitHub repository.
